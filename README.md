# MATLAB Integration for Jupyter

This repository contains two possible solutions for running Jupyter速 with MATLAB速 integration, inside a Docker速 container:

1. Use MATLAB Integration for Jupyter in a Docker Container (matlab)

2. Use MATLAB Integration for Jupyter using VNC in a Docker Container (matlab-vnc)

## Choose the Right Solution

The recommended solution is [Use MATLAB Integration for Jupyter in a Docker Container](matlab). It supports MATLAB R2020b or later (64 bit Linux速) but it has some limitations (see [Specifications and Limitations](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online/limitations.html)).

If you want to use an earlier version of MATLAB, or if you need any features described as limitations in [Specifications and Limitations](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online/limitations.html) use the solution [Use MATLAB Integration for Jupyter using VNC in a Docker Container](matlab-vnc) to connect to a traditional MATLAB desktop via VNC.
